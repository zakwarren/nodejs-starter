# Node.js starter pack

This is a very basic Node.js app that can be used as an easy
way to start new Node projects.

## Quick start

Open a command terminal in the directory and enter:

```bash
 npm install
 npm start
 ```

## Packages

This pack contains only the minimum collection of
packages that I like to use when starting a new Node
project. These are:

- [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)
- [express.js](http://expressjs.com/)
- [ejs](https://ejs.co/)
